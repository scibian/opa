.SH NAME
opaxlattopology

.NL

.PP
Generates a topology XML file of a cluster using topology.csv, linksum\(ulswd06.csv, and linksum\(ulswd24.csv as input. The topology file can be used to bring up and verify the cluster.
.PP

.B NOTE:
The topology.csv input file must be present in the same directory from which the script operates, but the linksum CSV files are read from the /usr/share/opa/samples directory.

.SH Syntax

opaxlattopology [-d \fIlevel\fR] [-v \fIlevel\fR] [-i \fIlevel\fR] [-K] [-s \fIhfi\(ulsuffix\fR] [source [dest]]

Produces full help text.

.TP 10
-d \fIlevel\fR 
.NL
Specifies the output detail level. Default = 0. Levels are additive.

.IP
By default, the top level is always produced. Switch, rack, and rack group topology files can be added to the output by choosing the appropriate level. If the output at the group or rack level is specified, then group or rack names must be provided in the spreadsheet. Detailed output can be specified in any combination. A directory for each topology XML file is created hierarchically, with group directories (if specified) at the highest level, followed by rack and switch directories (if specified).

-K 
.NL
Specifies DO NOT clean temporary files.

.IP
Prevents temporary files in each topology directory from being removed. Temporary files contain CSV formatted lists of links, HFIs, and switches used to create a topology XML file. Temporary files are not typically needed after a topology file is created, however they are used for creating linksum\(ulswd06.csv and linksum\(ulswd24.csv files, or can be retained for subsequent inspection or processing.
.TP 10
-s \fIhfi\(ulsuffix\fR 
.NL
Used on Multi-Rail or Multi-Plane fabrics. Can be used to override the default hfi1\(ul0.

.IP
For Multi-Plane fabric, use the tool multiple times with a different hfi-suffix.
.IP
For Multi-Rail fabric, specify HostName as "HostName HfiName" in the spreadsheet.
.SH Description
.NL

.PP
The opaxlattopology script reads the topology.csv file from the local directory, and reads the other files from /usr/share/opa/samples/linksum\(ulswd06.csv and /usr/share/opa/samples/linksum\(ulswd24.csv. The topology.csv file is created from the topology.xlsx spreadsheet by saving the Fabric Links tab as a .CSV file to topology.csv. A sample topology.xlsx is located in the /usr/share/opa/samples/ directory. Inspect the topology.csv file to ensure that each row contains the correct and same number of comma separators. Any extraneous entries in the spreadsheet can cause the CSV output to have extra fields.
.PP
The script outputs one or more topology files starting with topology.0:0.xml. The topology.csv input file must be present in the same directory from which the script operates, but the linksum CSV files are read from the /usr/share/opa/samples directory.
.SH Example 
.NL
opaxlattopology
.br
# reads default input \[aq]topology.csv\[aq] and creates default
.br
# output \[aq]topology.0:0.xml\[aq]
.br

.br
opaxlattopology fabric\(ul2.csv
.br
# reads input \[aq]fabric\(ul2.csv\[aq] and creates default output
.PP
See topology.xlsx for examples of links between HFI and Edge SW (rows 4-7), HFI and Core SW (rows 8-11), and Edge SW and Core SW (rows 12-15).
.SH Environment Variables
.NL

.PP
The following environment variables allow user-specified MTU.
.TP 10
\fBMTU\(ulSW\(ulSW\fR 
.NL
If set, it overrides default MTU on switch-to-switch links. Default = 10240

.TP 10
\fBMTU\(ulSW\(ulHFI\fR 
.NL
If set, it overrides default MTU on switch-to-HFI links. Default = 10240

.SH Creating linksum Files
.NL

.PP
The linksum\(ulswd06.csv and linksum\(ulswd24.csv files are provided as stand-alone files in the /usr/share/opa/samples directory. However, they can be recreated (or modified) from the spreadsheet, if needed, by performing the following steps:

.IP 1) 4n 
Save each of the following from the topology.xlsx file as individual .csv files:
.IP \(bu
Internal SWD06 Links tab as linksum\(ulswd06.csv 
.IP \(bu
Internal SWD24 Links tab as linksum\(ulswd24.csv 
.IP \(bu
Fabric Links tab as topology.csv 

.IP 2) 4n 
For each saved topology.csv file, run the script with the -K option.

.IP 3) 4n 
Upon completion of the script, save the top level linksum.csv file as linksum\(ulswd06.csv or linksum\(ulswd24.csv as appropriate.

.SH Multi Rail and Multi Plane Fabrics
.NL

.PP
By default, the opaxlattopology script considers all of the hosts to have a single HFI (hfi1\(ul0).
.PP
For Multi Rail/Plane fabrics, the user has following options:
.IP \(bu
For Multi Rail fabrics or for a Single Plane fabric with some multi-ported hosts, the user can edit the "Host Name" in topology.csv file to include the HFI Name, like "HostName HfiName" and then follow the standard procedure to generate topology.xml.
.IP \(bu
For a Multi Plane fabric with Identical planes, the tool can be run multiple times on same topology.csv with different "-s hfi\(ulsuffix" options.For example, if there are two identical fabric (fabric\(ul1 and fabric\(ul2) connected to a single host with two HFIs (hfi1\(ul0 and hfi1\(ul1), the tool can be run twice like this:
For fabric\(ul1:
opaxlattopology topology.csv topology.xmlFor fabric\(ul2:

.br
opaxlattopology -s hfi1\(ul1 topology.csv topology.xml

.IP \(bu
For a fabric with both Multi Rail and Multi Plane segments, the user can use a combination of above techniques to generate desired topology.xml file.
